## FurnishIt: A Furniture Manager Application

**1. What will the application do?**

This furniture manager is designed to make shopping for furniture easier and quicker. Users will be able to perform the
following tasks:  

- Create a new house or apartment to be furnished
- List down rooms and their measurements
- Check whether there is enough square footage in a room to add a certain piece of furniture
- If there is space, the furniture is added to the room along with details such as furniture type, brand, price, and 
  color.
  
**2. Who will use it?**

This application can be used by anyone who is moving into a new house or an unfurnished apartment and wants to make 
his or her furniture shopping experience easier.

**3. Why is this project of interest to me?**

I will be moving into an unfurnished apartment soon. I am finding it difficult to keep track of all the furniture I need
to purchase, so this application can hopefully help solve this problem.
